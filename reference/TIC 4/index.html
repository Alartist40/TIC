                <h2>About Our Church</h2>
                <p>Tokyo International Seventh-day Adventist Church, more commonly known as TIC, grew out of the need for foreign nationals in Tokyo to meet and worship in English over 20 years ago. The church has grown to support a weekly attendance of 150 people coming from diverse countries around the globe, such as the Philippines, India, Brazil, USA, Ghana, Kenya, and many more. We also have many Japanese members who like to be a part of our strong fellowship.</p>
                <p>We are a spirited church that seeks to worship the Lord in holiness and to reach out and share His word with other English speakers in Japan.</p>
                <p>TIC has become known for being a sanctuary for Christ in the heart of a tourist and fashion district; a church on Church Ave juxtaposed next to modern shopping malls.</p>
