							Tokyo International Seventh-day Adventist Church, more commonly known as TIC, grew out of the need for foreign nationals in Tokyo to meet and worship in English over 20 years ago. The church has grown to support a weekly attendance of 150 people coming from diverse countries around the globe, such as the Philippines, India, Brazil, USA, Ghana, Kenya, and many more. We also have many Japanese members who like to be a part of our strong fellowship.

We are a spirited church that seeks to worship the Lord in holiness and to reach out and share His word with other English speakers in Japan.

TIC has become known for being a sanctuary for Christ in the heart of a tourist and fashion district; a church on Church Ave juxtaposed next to modern shopping malls.

							As Seventh-day Adventists we believe in the Bible as our creed and hold certain fundamental beliefs to be the teaching of the Holy Scriptures. These beliefs, as set forth here, constitute the church's understanding and expression of the teaching of Scripture.

As Adventists we believe in the 28 fundamental doctrines that can be organized into six categories: God, Humanity, Salvation, The Church, The Christian Life, and Last Day Events.

For a complete list and detailed explanation of the 28 Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, please visit the official Adventist.org website.

								Pastor Guenji Imayuki is a second-generation Japanese born in Brazil. He graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering at ITA and worked in the financial area for a few years. Despite the comfortable lifestyle, he reached a turning point in his career and understood that it was a call to ministry. With the support of his wife to study theology, he needed a special vote as he graduated overage in 2008.

He served as district pastor for 7 years in Brazil, the last one as the inter-conference district of Japanese churches. Then, he accepted a call to be director of Resident Foreigners Evangelism at JUC and Latino churches district, including Tokai Christian Center, Isesaki, Chiba Latino, and church planting project at Suwa.

He enjoys digging deeper into the Word of God believing in its power to touch our hearts, as stated in his favorite Bible passage.
