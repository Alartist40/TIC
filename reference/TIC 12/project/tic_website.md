The Creation Grid
The most important element in the design system is what we are calling the “Creation Grid.” This is a seven-column layout structure to be used in the majority of design situations to communicate our conviction that all time leads to a beautiful end.
The first six columns are yours to fill with text, images, illustrations, patterns, logos or anything else, and in those six columns you should do all your work of communicating information. But the seventh-column, the Sabbath column, is to be set apart—to be special and different from the other six columns, as a reminder and visual celebration of the last day.
   
We all celebrate the Sabbath in different ways, so how you make the Sabbath column different and special is, to an extent, up to you. The principle to keep in mind is contrast. You can do something complex and colorful in the first six columns, or you can do that with the seventh column, but if you do it on both sides then the seventh-column is no longer different.
 
Other than that, the Sabbath column can be filled with just about any background element—a full-bleed image, a texture, pattern, illustration, bold colors, a gradient, or even white space—as long as it is beautiful and fills the entire column. Aside from full-background elements, the seventh-column should never include identifying marks or text of any kind, with the exception of the Adventist Symbol.
Though the Adventist Symbol can be placed anywhere in a layout, it is the only non-background element that may be placed in the Sabbath column.
         
There are certainly instances when using the grid might not make sense for your particular context or application. In those instances it is permissible and even encouraged that you ignore the grid and place the symbol/artwork as needed. This would typically apply to applications in which the symbol stands alone or is not intended to be integrated with the surrounding layout.

**Project Specifics:** - **Website Type:** Main website for a church (Seventh-day Adventist, based on the logo request). - **Purpose:** A "brochure" site to showcase the church's identity, values, leadership, service times, and contact information. - **Design Mandate:** Modern aesthetic. The core layout must be a 7-column grid system where the 7th column is intentionally left blank except for a centered SDA logo. This is a key design and symbolic feature. - **Hosting:** The final code will be handed off to the church for hosting on their existing platform.

About Our Church
Tokyo International Seventh-day Adventist Church, more commonly known as TIC, grew out of the need for foreign nationals in Tokyo to meet and worship in English over 20 years ago. The church has grown to support a weekly attendance of 150 people coming from diverse countries around the globe, such as the Philippines, India, Brazil, USA, Ghana, Kenya, and many more. We also have many Japanese members who like to be a part of our strong fellowship.

We are a spirited church that seeks to worship the Lord in holiness and to reach out and share His word with other English speakers in Japan.

TIC has become known for being a sanctuary for Christ in the heart of a tourist and fashion district; a church on Church Ave juxtaposed next to modern shopping malls.

Our Core Beliefs
As Seventh-day Adventists we believe in the Bible as our creed and hold certain fundamental beliefs to be the teaching of the Holy Scriptures. These beliefs, as set forth here, constitute the church's understanding and expression of the teaching of Scripture.

As Adventists we believe in the 28 fundamental doctrines that can be organized into six categories: God, Humanity, Salvation, The Church, The Christian Life, and Last Day Events.

For a complete list and detailed explanation of the 28 Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, please visit the official Adventist.org website.

Our Church Pastor
"For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven,
And do not return there,
But water the earth,
And make it bring forth and bud,
That it may give seed to the sower
And bread to the eater,
So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth;
It shall not return to Me void,
But it shall accomplish what I please,
And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it."
— Isaiah 55:10-11

Pastor Guenji Imayuki
Pastor Guenji Imayuki is a second-generation Japanese born in Brazil. He graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering at ITA (Air Force Institute of Technology) and worked in the financial area for a few years. Despite the comfortable lifestyle, he reached a turning point in his career and understood that it was a call to ministry. With the support of his wife to study theology, he needed a special vote as he graduated overage in 2008.

He served as district pastor for 7 years in Brazil, the last one as the inter-conference district of Japanese churches. Then, he accepted a call to be director of Resident Foreigners Evangelism at JUC and Latino churches district, including Tokai Christian Center, Isesaki, Chiba Latino, and church planting project at Suwa.

He enjoys digging deeper into the Word of God believing in its power to touch our hearts, as stated in his favorite Bible passage.

Eliane Hosokawa Imayuki
Eliane Hosokawa Imayuki comes from a pastoral family and all her 3 siblings also serve the church. She graduated college of Letters at the most prestigious university in Brazil, USP, and besides teaching career at all levels of Seventh-day Adventist schools she authored Portuguese textbooks adopted nationwide by our denominational school network.

She is still updating the textbooks remotely, but her current passion is to implement the center of influence model in our churches and is happy to have all four children living close now in Tokyo.
